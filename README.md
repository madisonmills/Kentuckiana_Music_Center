# Code Louisville Front-End Project

## Description 
Hi!
This is my attempt to improve the site: Kentuckianamusiccenter.com, a website of a local music store. From the time I started this project to now, I have seen their site change multiple times! There were several things that I wanted to fix such as a footer that collapsed and a lot of white space on their site. Neither site is perfect, but it has been a fun project and learning experience. 
This site navigates you through the different components that are offered by the store.

## Main Features 
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used. 
- Responsive navigation menu 
- HTML form with validation

## Feature Requirements
- Navigation menu that responds 
- Uses “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements
- Form with input validation using Javascript 
- Flexbox used for styling navigation 
- Image carousel using Javascript
