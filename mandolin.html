<h1>Mandolin</h1>
<p>The mandolin is tuned in the same tuning as the violin, only on the mandolin, there are eight strings.
    Each pair of strings is tuned to the same pitch, G G, A A, D D, E E.

<p>Bill Monroe is often coined as the Father of Bluegrass. 
    This was in large part due to his band called The Blue Grass Boys.
    The groups name was taken from Monroe's home state of Kentucky.
