    <p>Welcome to Kentuckiana Music Center. This store has been around in some form or another in various locations in Downtown New Albany, IN for the past 30 years. 
    We offer lessons, instrument rentals, consignments, repairs, retail, and booking services. Our new location is at 134 E Elm St, New Albany IN 47150! 
    We're undergoing some building remodeling, so bear with us as we get situated.</p>
    
    <h3>HOURS</h3>
<p>Monday - Friday 11 AM-1PM & 2PM-6PM</p>
<p>Saturday 10AM-2PM</p>

<h4>COVID-19 Updates:</h4>
    <p>Kentuckiana Music Center will be opening a week later per the Indiana Back on Track Plan on May 11. We are under more construction, so this extra week will allow us to reconfigure spaces and put extra precautions in place. 
    What this means is we will be open during regular business hours for walk in business and reopening in person lessons in a limited capacity. We will be allowing limited in store lessons to resume at the discretion of teachers and students. 
    We want everyone to feel safe. We will continue to offer online lessons for any students and teachers wishing to continue their education in that manner. We also recommend those already doing online lessons to consider continuing this style of lesson thru May to keep our capacity lowered. 
    There is a bathroom for hand washing and we will have hand sanitizer stations in the store and the other lesson waiting room. PLEASE do not take these home with you. At the request of the state the store will be providing all teachers with face masks. 
    We politely request customers also wear masks when coming in. Again, we just want everyone to feel safe if you choose to come by our business as Indiana starts to reopen.</p>
